## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

Purpose of this project is to provide a simple consistent pattern and api for managing both app state and local state in UI development.

Reactive programming has made a lot of inroads in UI development because it provides a predictable way to update complex application state and reduce side effects. Redux is probably the most famouse example.

However when it comes to local state there is still a lot of variation on how to handle it

  i.e in React
  - imperatively with `useState`
  - declarative with `useReducer`

  - and how about async actions?
    - imperatively dispatching before and after a promise resolves.
    - setting up middlewares to work with `useReducer`

Imperatively managed state is often the choice for simple local state. But if state gets more complicated it becomes harder to keep track of side effects.

Imperatively managed state is often more difficult to test vs state managed by pure reducer functions.

This project hopes to provide a more consistent way of managing app and local state and make it easy to develop and test.

## Core concepts <a name="core-concepts"></a>

Taking inspiraton from [redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts) and [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/guide/store), Hubfx uses the same concepts regarding Actions, Effects, Reducers, Store. These concepts are coupled with RxJS observables to manage state modelled as reactive streams.

In this documentation the term *stream* will refer to an RxJS observable stream.

### Hub and Stores <a name="hub-stores"></a>

The **Hub** is responsible for dispatching actions to the store(s) registered to the hub. It is also responsible for handling side effects. The main stream that initiates all actions and effects is the `dispatcher$`

### Effects<a name="effects"></a>

When initializing a hub we can declare effects. The hub can listen for various actions and perform side-effects as needed. Stores that are registered to the hub will be listening to these effects as well the `dispatcher$`.

**Scoped Effects** dynamically create effect streams scoped to a particular action & key combination when an action is dispatch.<a name="scoped-effects"></a>

### Integrating with UI <a name="integration"></a>
A network of hubs and stores can be integrated with UI components without tight coupling. Separating presentation concerns improves testability and allows developers to decide how to integrate with UI components.

### Unidirectional Flow <a name="unidirectional-flow"></a>
All actions and data will flow through the App in one direction.

<img src="https://github.com/laidav/hubfx/blob/main/documentation/SlideSevenEightUnidirectionalFlow.jpg?raw=true" />

## API <a name="api"></a>

### Hub <a name="hub"></a>

#### Basic Usage <a name="hub-usage"></a>

```typescript
const hub = HubFactory();

const countReducer = (state = { counter: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { counter: state.counter + 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

const count$ = hub.store({ reducer: countReducer });

count$.subscribe((count) => console.log(count));

hub.dispatch({ type: 'increment' });

// Output
// 1
```

#### Store Config <a name="store-config"></a>

```typescript
export interface StoreConfig<T> {
  reducer: Reducer<T>;
  initialState?: T;
  name?: string; // name for store to show up in debugging
  debug?: boolean; // This will console log all messages the store receives and the prev and new state
}
```
Debug Example

#### messages$ <a name="hub-messages"></a>
The hub also exposes a `Hub.messages$` observable of all the actions stores receive. It can be helpful for testing how your hub is handling actions and effects.

#### Angular Example <a name="hub-angular-example"></a>

Using our above count example we can integrate with an Angular component. 

```typescript
import { Component, Input, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { HubFactory } from '@hubfx/core';
import { countReducer } from '/countReducer;

export class CounterComponent {
  @Input() hub = HubFactory();
  count$: Observable<number>;

  increment() {
    this.hub.dispatch({ type: 'increment' });
  }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.count$ = this.hub.store({ reducer: countReducer });
  }
}

```

#### React Example <a name="hub-react-example"></a>

Using our above count example we can integrate with a React component. 

```typescript
import { useHub } from './useHub';
import { useObservable } from './useObservable';
import { countReducer } from './countReducer';

const Counter = (({ hub = useHub() })) => {

  const count = useObservable(hub.store(countReducer));

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={ () => {hub.dispatch({ type: 'increment' }); }}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}


```

Hook to store a hub reference.

```typescript
// useHub.ts

import { useRef } from 'react';
import { HubFactory } from '@hubfx/core';

export const useHub = () => {
  return useRef(HubFactory()).current;
};
```

Hook to bind observable to React state.

```typescript
// useObservable.ts

import { useEffect, useState, useRef } from 'react';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

export const useObservable = <T>(obs$: Observable<T>) => {
  const currentObs$ = useRef(obs$).current;
  const [state, setState] = useState<T | undefined>(undefined);

  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = currentObs$.subscribe((result) => {
      setState(result);
    });

    const unsubscribe = subscription.unsubscribe.bind(
      subscription,
    ) as () => void;

    return unsubscribe;
  }, []);

  return state;
};
```

### Scoped Effects in Action <a name="action-scoped-effects"></a>

<img src="https://github.com/laidav/hubfx/blob/main/documentation/SlideThreeScopedEffects.jpg?raw=true" width="600" />

Scoped effects can be declared in the action declaration and created with action creators. When the action is dispatched the hub will register a stream with the Action & key (if it hasnt already).

The stream can then be manuipulated by piping operators as required.

You can also have more than one effect and each stream will be independent of each other.

```typescript

const UPDATE_TODO = 'UPDATE_TODO';
const UPDATE_TODO_SUCCESS = 'UPDATE_TODO_SUCCESS';
const updateTodo = ({ id, message }, todoService: TodoService) => ({
  type: UPDATE_TODO,
  payload: message,
  scopedEffects: {
    key: id,
    effects: [
      (actions$: Observable<Action<string>>) =>
        actions$.pipe(
          mergeMap((action) => todoService.updateTodo(id, action.payload))
          map(({ data }) => ({
            type: UPDATE_TODO_SUCCESS,
            payload: data
          }))
        )
    ]
  }
})
```
